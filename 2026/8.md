## **Insufficient checks for the order of genes**

**Vulnerability Pattern:** Input Validation

**Severity:** Low

**Ecosystem:** Sui

**Protocol:** MystenLabs Sui

**Auditor:** OtterSec

**Report:** 

[https://ottersec.notion.site/Sampled-Public-Audit-Reports-a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772](https://www.notion.so/a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772?pvs=21)

**Report Date:** May 2023

**Description:** definitions_from_bcs should ensure the correct order of genes. Otherwise, if definitions are set in an incorrect order, receiving parts of the value becomes impossible.

**Recommendation:** Store prev_selector in a variable outside the loop and check if current_selector is greater than prev_selector to ensure that selector is always increasing.

**Coding/Auditing Tip:** When taking in a vector of information, take into consideration the ordering of that information and if it will have any effect in the current function and its output.
