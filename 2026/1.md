**Description:** Other functions like increase_treasury_balance and update_state exist to increase and update treasury balance. However, there is a missing function to withdraw_treasury amount. Therefore, funds become locked in the pool.

**Coding/Auditing Tip:** If a function is implemented, take into account its interaction with other functions, states, and balances and ensure they exist!
