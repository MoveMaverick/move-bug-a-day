## **Users may arbitrarily decrease the remaining mixes of their SuiFrens**

**Vulnerability Pattern:** Access Control/Input Validation

**Severity:** Low

**Ecosystem:** Sui

**Protocol:** MystenLabs Sui

**Auditor:** OtterSec

**Report:** 

[https://ottersec.notion.site/Sampled-Public-Audit-Reports-a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772](https://www.notion.so/Sampled-Public-Audit-Reports-a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772?pvs=21)

**Report Date:** May 2023

**Description:** Users may arbitrarily call decrease_remaining_mixes_by_one. Users may supply their SuiFrens and reduce the remaining mix in the object without minting a new SuiFrens. This function also does not check if the remaining_mix is set to None(), aborting the application.

**Recommendation:**

1. Ensure that the function may be called only during the mixing process.
2. Add a check to ensure that the remaining_mix is not set to None().

**Coding/Auditing Tip:** Ensure functions have appropriate access control measures and input parameters have proper checks.
