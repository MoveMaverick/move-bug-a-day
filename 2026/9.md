## **Erroneous checks allow the user to create an invalid discount code**

**Vulnerability Pattern:** Input Validation

**Severity:** Low

**Ecosystem:** Sui

**Protocol:** MystenLabs Sui

**Auditor:** OtterSec

**Report:** 

[https://ottersec.notion.site/Sampled-Public-Audit-Reports-a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772](https://www.notion.so/a296e98838aa4fdb8f3b192663400772?pvs=21)

**Report Date:** May 2023

**Description:** 

In remove_later::deserialize_discount_code, the current validation for the discount code
rate during deserialization is incorrect, as it only checks if the rate is greater than zero or less than three characters. The intended validation should verify that the rate is greater than zero and less than three characters.

**Recommendation:** Modify the logical operator used in the validation to ensure that both checks are executed.

**Coding/Auditing Tip:** Ensure that checks are properly implemented and account for all necessary requirements.
